4 models are seperately trained aiming the 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x noisy depth map super-resolution.

You can download them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o3vboZ20PhnOxLFP7U6trWJEdrJG8n3d?hl=zh_CN).

You can test them in comprehensive [testset](https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/G2-MonoDepth), where we adopt raw_100% as our raw input.

aim16_epoch_60.pth performs best in real scene depth enhancement.
